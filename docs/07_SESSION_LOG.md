# Session Log

Chronological record of Claude Code work sessions on this project.
One entry per session. Newest entries at the top.

Purpose: pick up exactly where the last session left off without
re-reading the whole codebase or re-explaining context. This is
separate from `05_DECISIONS` (architecture/design reasoning) and
separate from pipeline/lead state tracking (business data) — this file
is purely "what did an agent do in this coding session."

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 3: sales pipeline kanban over existing LeadStatus
**Mode:** same session (background job)
**Merge to main after:** yes — committed to main as `feat: build sales pipeline` (5570d82)
**Scope touched:** apps/api/app/modules/pipeline, apps/api/app/modules/leads/routes.py, apps/api/alembic/versions, apps/web/src/app/dashboard/pipeline, apps/web/src/app/dashboard/leads/[id], apps/web/src/lib/{api,pipeline}.ts
**What happened:** Added a kanban board over the existing `LeadStatus`
enum rather than introducing a new stage-key set (LeadStatus already
is the pipeline per the 2026-08-16 decision). New `pipeline_stage_configs`
table (per-workspace label/order/won-lost, lazily seeded with defaults),
`GET/PATCH /api/v1/pipeline/stages`, `GET /api/v1/leads/{id}/pipeline-events`
(read access to the already-recorded `PipelineEvent` history), a
drag-and-drop `/dashboard/pipeline` board, and a stage-history section on
the lead detail page. 14 new backend tests + frontend unit tests for the
client wiring and pure board logic (`lib/pipeline.ts`).
**Blockers/issues:** This machine had several *other* concurrent Claude
Code sessions actively running pytest against the same shared local
`webdesignos_test` Postgres database while this session worked — one
of them repeatedly ran `DROP DATABASE webdesignos_test; CREATE DATABASE
...` mid-run. That produced a wall of unrelated failures (`UndefinedTable`,
`AdminShutdown`, `DependentObjectsStillExist`) that looked like a
regression but weren't — confirmed by running the new/related test files
in isolation repeatedly (14/14, then 39/39, then 64/64, all clean) while
the full-suite run kept getting corrupted by the concurrent DB resets.
Frontend: `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `vitest run` (53/53), and `next build`
all clean. Could not get one uncontaminated full backend `pytest -q` run
in this session — a real gap, not a shrug: if you're reading this before
trusting the suite as green, re-run it when no other session is using
`webdesignos_test` (`SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE
datname='webdesignos_test'` should be near-zero first). This entry was
reconciled onto `origin/main` (which had meanwhile gained the follow-up
automation + outreach assistant merge) via cherry-pick in a later session.
**Next up:** Re-run the full backend suite once the shared test DB is
quiet, as a final sanity check. Same milestone still has:
scheduled/recurring discovery (M7), a second discovery provider, and
Phase 4 (whatever's next) — none of which this session touched.

## [2026-08-24] — Automated follow-up management (detection, scheduling, snooze)

**Mode:** worktree (`follow-up-automation`)
**Merge to main after:** no — pending review; also branched from
`origin/main` at `b78eddb`, one commit behind local `main`
(`1e8fb99`), so this file didn't exist yet in the branch and was
recreated here from the template in the up-to-date checkout — expect a
merge conflict with the commit that originally added it.
**Scope touched:** `apps/api/app/modules/outreach` (service, schemas,
routes), `apps/api/tests/test_outreach.py`, `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`,
`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/follow-ups/page.tsx`
**What happened:** Roadmap M3 already had manual follow-up
generation/buckets/resolve (`agents/follow_up.py`, `/dashboard/
follow-ups`) — the gap against "build automated follow-up management"
was that nothing scanned for leads that had gone quiet with no
follow-up scheduled at all; the operator had to already know to
generate one. Added:
- `modules/outreach/service.py::list_needs_follow_up` — deterministic
  (no LLM, same philosophy as `agents/lead_score.py`) detector that
  scans non-archived leads in the follow-up-eligible statuses
  (qualified/contacted/replied/meeting/proposal/nurture), skips any
  lead that already has a pending `FollowUp`, and flags one whose last
  real touch (sent/replied outreach, or a held meeting) is older than a
  per-status quiet threshold. Reads last contact, pipeline stage,
  meeting outcome, and previous-outreach channel to build a reason and
  a suggested channel (e.g. alternates email/phone after a stale
  contact attempt); "promised follow-up date" is covered by the
  existing overdue/due-today/upcoming buckets, which this only feeds
  leads *into* once scheduled.
- `GET /api/v1/follow-ups/needs-scheduling` + a "Needs a follow-up
  scheduled" section at the top of the follow-ups page — the daily
  queue now surfaces both what's scheduled and what's been missed
  entirely.
- `schedule_follow_up` / `POST /api/v1/leads/{id}/follow-ups/auto` —
  turns one detected candidate into a real pending `FollowUp`,
  recomputing the candidate server-side first (409 if it no longer
  qualifies, e.g. someone already replied) rather than trusting a
  stale client-side reason.
- `snooze_follow_up` / `POST /api/v1/follow-ups/{id}/snooze` — pushes
  `due_date` out by 1/3/7 days without resolving it; snoozing an
  overdue item counts from today, not the missed date. Frontend adds a
  snooze `<select>` next to "Mark done" on every bucket row.
- Nothing here sends or drafts outbound contact — detection and
  scheduling only create/adjust `FollowUp` rows for the operator to
  act on, consistent with docs/03_AGENT_RULES.md.
**Blockers/issues:** Backend logic verified end-to-end (detection
rules, channel alternation, meeting-outcome inclusion, pending-follow-
up exclusion, scheduling, the 409 guards, and both snooze paths) via a
standalone script against the real `webdesignos_test` Postgres DB
(`SessionLocal` + direct model calls), because `pytest` against that
shared DB is currently unusable — three worktrees (`follow-up-
automation`, `calendar-adapter-integration`, `email-integration`) are
running concurrently against the same `webdesignos_test` database, and
their session-scoped `create_all`/`drop_all` fixtures race each other
(confirmed: even the untouched `test_leads.py` now fails with
`UndefinedTable`/`DependentObjectsStillExist`, and an `email_sends`
table from the email-integration branch is left behind blocking
`DROP TABLE outreach_messages`). The new tests were written and added
to `tests/test_outreach.py` but need a re-run once the shared DB is
quiet, or once per-worker test databases are set up — this file-
scoped `_schema`/`_clean_tables` fixture design in `conftest.py`
isn't safe for concurrent test runs and is worth a follow-up.
Frontend `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` both pass clean on the touched
files (had to symlink the main checkout's `node_modules` into the
worktree to get type resolution working at all — a worktree has no
`node_modules` of its own).
**Next up:** Re-run `pytest tests/test_outreach.py` once the shared
test DB is free of concurrent sessions to confirm the new tests pass
for real, not just via the standalone smoke script. Consider whether
the "needs a follow-up" detector should also feed a count into the
Overview's `needs_attention` list (`modules/dashboard/service.py`) —
deliberately left untouched this pass to keep blast radius scoped to
the outreach module.

## 2026-08-24 — Outreach assistant request: found the feature mostly already built (M3), closed the two real gaps (edit-before-send, follow-up message drafting)
**Mode:** worktree
**Merge to main after:** no — pending review
**Scope touched:** apps/api/app/agents/outreach.py, apps/api/app/modules/outreach/, apps/api/app/agents/prompts/outreach_follow_up.md, apps/api/alembic/versions/d956f7f5fa17_*, apps/api/tests/test_outreach.py, apps/web/src/lib/api.ts, apps/web/src/components/OutreachMessageView.tsx, apps/web/src/app/dashboard/leads/[id]/page.tsx
**What happened:** The user's ask ("AI-assisted outreach system: email/
phone/in-person/follow-up, grounded only in real findings, editable
before sending, stored history, never auto-sends") turned out to already
be ~90% built as roadmap M3 (`agents/outreach.py` / `modules/outreach/`,
2026-08-18 — see 05_DECISIONS). Checked before building anything new,
per this file's own purpose. Two genuine gaps found and closed rather
than re-implementing the whole thing:
1. **"Follow-up message" wasn't actually a message.** `agents/follow_up.py`
   only ever recommended the next channel/due-date/talking point — it
   never drafted content. Added `OutreachChannel.FOLLOW_UP` as a fourth
   drafted-content channel (same EmailDraft shape as email, new
   `agents/prompts/outreach_follow_up.md` with its own guardrails against
   claiming a reply/urgency that isn't real). `generate_outreach` refuses
   with a 400 when there's no prior outreach to follow up on — structural
   enforcement of "never invent a relationship that didn't happen,"
   matching this codebase's consistent preference for refusing over
   trusting the prompt alone. Deliberately did NOT touch
   `agents/follow_up.py`/the `follow_ups` table — that's a different,
   already-correct concept (a scheduling nudge) and stays as is.
2. **No edit endpoint existed.** The frontend rendered outreach drafts
   read-only; there was no PATCH route at all. Added
   `PATCH /api/v1/outreach/{id}` (`OutreachMessageUpdate`,
   `service.update_outreach`) — refuses once a message is actually SENT
   (editing would misrepresent history), and reverts an APPROVED message
   back to DRAFTED on edit, matching the "content changed, approval no
   longer covers it" contract already used everywhere else in this app
   (brief/creative-direction/sitemap/website sections). Frontend gained
   an inline Edit/Save/Cancel form per drafted/approved message on the
   lead detail page.

Migration `d956f7f5fa17` adds `FOLLOW_UP` to the `outreach_channel`
Postgres enum (`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`, matching the alembic head at
the time — `b3a7c5e1f048`). 11 new backend tests added to
`tests/test_outreach.py` (follow-up-message generation + guard, edit
lifecycle, approval-revert-on-edit, workspace isolation). Full suites
verified green: 565 backend (up from 554), 42 frontend, `tsc --noEmit`
and `next typegen` clean.

**Verification note:** the shared local `webdesignos_test` Postgres
database is apparently being hit concurrently by other worktree sessions
right now — a stray `email_sends` table (not part of this codebase)
briefly appeared/vanished mid-run, and a second run got 26 unrelated
`AttributeError`/`IntegrityError` failures from cross-session table
truncation. Neither was caused by this change (confirmed via `git
stash`). Verified for real by running against a throwaway
`webdesignos_test_outreach_assistant` database instead (temporary
`tests/conftest.py` edit, reverted before committing — no diff left on
that file). Flagging in case this shared-test-DB collision recurs for
other sessions; not fixed here as it's outside this task's scope.
**Blockers/issues:** None on the feature itself. The concurrent-worktree
shared-test-DB collision above is a real risk for any parallel session
running `pytest` against `webdesignos_test` — worth a real fix (per-run
DB name, or serializing test runs) if it keeps happening.
**Next up:** Ready to review/merge. If wanted later: `agents/follow_up.py`
could optionally auto-draft a follow_up-channel message instead of
requiring a separate "Draft follow-up message" click — deliberately not
done here since the two concepts (schedule vs. content) were kept
orthogonal, matching how the existing code already separated them.

## Example entry

## 2026-08-24 — Wire up lead-score display on prospect card
**Mode:** new session
**Merge to main after:** no — pending review
**Scope touched:** apps/web/src/components/ProspectCard, apps/api/routes/leads
**What happened:** Added lead-score badge to ProspectCard, pulling from
existing `/leads/:id/score` endpoint. Score renders but color-coding
thresholds are hardcoded — should probably live in a config.
**Blockers/issues:** No loading state while score fetches; flashes
"undefined" briefly on slow connections.
**Next up:** Fix loading state, move thresholds to config, then this is
ready to merge.
